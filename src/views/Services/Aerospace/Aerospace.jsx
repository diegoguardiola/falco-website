                <h2>Machining</h2>
                <h4>CNC Machining</h4>
                <p>
                    Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining is a fundamental capability in aerospace manufacturing. CNC machines use computer 
                    programs to control the movement of cutting tools, allowing for highly accurate and repeatable machining of complex parts. 
                    This includes milling, turning, and multi-axis machining processes.
                </p>
                <h4>5-Axis Machining</h4>
                <p>
                    Aerospace components often have intricate geometries, including undercuts and compound angles. 5-axis machining centers can 
                    access all sides of a workpiece, enabling the production of complex parts with high precision. This is particularly crucial 
                    for components like turbine blades and structural elements.
                </p>
                <h4>High-Precision Tolerences</h4>
                <p>
                    Aerospace parts typically require tight tolerances to ensure proper fit and function. Machining capabilities must be able 
                    to consistently achieve these tolerances, often in the micron range, to meet aerospace industry standards and regulations.
                </p>
                <h4>Surface Finish and Quality</h4>
                <p>
                    Aerospace components demand superior surface finishes to reduce friction, improve aerodynamics, and prevent corrosion. 
                    Machining capabilities should include processes for achieving the required surface quality, such as polishing, honing, and lapping.
                </p>
                <h4>Inspection and Quality Control</h4>
                <p>
                    Stringent quality control and inspection processes are essential in aerospace machining. Advanced metrology tools, such as Coordinate 
                    Measuring Machines (CMMs), laser scanners, and optical comparators, are used to verify part dimensions and ensure compliance with 
                    specifications.
