                <p>
                    SCADA, which stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, is a system used in various industries 
                    to monitor, control, and manage complex processes and equipment in real-time. SCADA systems provide a 
                    centralized platform for collecting data from remote devices and making decisions based on that data. 
                    These systems are instrumental in improving efficiency, safety, and productivity in a wide range of 
                    applications.

                <h2>Key Components of a SCADA System:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Supervisory Computers: These computers serve as the central control hub for the SCADA system. 
                        They collect data from remote field devices, display real-time information to operators, and 
                        allow operators to issue control commands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) or Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs): These are field devices 
                        that interface with sensors, instruments, and machinery at remote locations. RTUs and PLCs 
                        collect data from sensors, digitize it, and send it to the supervisory computer. They can also 
                        receive control commands from the supervisory computer and execute them locally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Communication Infrastructure: SCADA systems rely on communication networks to transmit data 
                        between the supervisory computers and remote field devices. This can include various technologies 
                        like Ethernet, radio, fiber optics, or satellite communication.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Human-Machine Interface (HMI): The HMI is the user interface that operators use to interact with 
                        the SCADA system. It displays real-time data, alarms, and control options in a user-friendly format.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Historian Database: A historian database stores historical data collected by the SCADA system. 
                        This data is used for analysis, reporting, and trend analysis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
