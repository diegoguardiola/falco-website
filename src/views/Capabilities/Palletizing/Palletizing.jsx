                <h1>What is Palletizing?</h1>
                <p>
                    Palletizing refers to the process of placing and securing goods or products on 
                    a pallet in preparation for shipping or storage. A pallet is a portable platform, 
                    typically made of wood, plastic, or metal, that allows goods to be handled and 
                    moved easily by equipment like forklifts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Palletizing is used in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, warehousing, 
                    and distribution, to efficiently manage the storage, handling, and transport of goods. 
                    It helps in reducing loading and unloading times, minimizing damage to products, and 
                    optimizing storage space in warehouses.
