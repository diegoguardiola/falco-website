                <h1>What is Palletization?</h1>
                <p>
                    Palletizing refers to the process of placing and securing goods or products on 
                    a pallet in preparation for shipping or storage. A pallet is a portable platform, 
                    typically made of wood, plastic, or metal, that allows goods to be handled and 
                    moved easily by equipment like forklifts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depalletizing is a process in material handling and logistics where items, typically 
                    boxes, packages, or products, are removed from a pallet. Pallets are often used in 
                    warehousing and transportation to efficiently store and transport multiple items at once. 
                    However, when it comes to further processing or distribution, it's necessary to unload the 
                    items from the pallet. This is where depalletizing systems come into play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Palletizing and depalletizing is used in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, warehousing, 
                    and distribution, to efficiently manage the storage, handling, and transport of goods. 
                    It helps in reducing loading and unloading times, minimizing damage to products, and 
                    optimizing storage space in warehouses.
