                <h1>What is Building Automation</h1>
                <p>
                    Building Automation (also known as Building Management System or BMS) is a centralized control system 
                    that uses computer technology to monitor and manage various building systems and services. Its primary 
                    goal is to enhance the efficiency, comfort, security, and sustainability of a building or facility by 
                    automating and optimizing the operation of its subsystems. Building automation is commonly used in 
                    commercial, industrial, and residential buildings to control a wide range of systems and processes.

                <h2>Key Components of Building Automation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span className='building-automation-info-bold'>Sensors and Actuators:</span> These are the eyes and hands of the system. Sensors, such as temperature 
                        sensors, occupancy sensors, light sensors, and humidity sensors, collect data from the building 
                        environment. Actuators, like motorized valves, dampers, and relays, execute control commands 
                        based on the data received from sensors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className='building-automation-info-bold'>Control System:</span> The control system is the brain of the building automation system. It processes 
                        data from sensors and uses it to make decisions and control various building systems. It often 
                        includes a central controller or a Building Management System (BMS) software.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className='building-automation-info-bold'>Communication Networks:</span> Building automation systems use communication networks to transmit data 
                        and commands between sensors, controllers, and other devices. Common protocols include BACnet, 
                        Modbus, LonWorks, and more recently, Internet of Things (IoT) protocols.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className='building-automation-info-bold'>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning):</span> HVAC systems are a major focus of building 
                        automation. The BMS can optimize temperature, humidity, and air quality by adjusting heating, 
                        cooling, and ventilation systems based on occupancy, weather conditions, and energy efficiency 
                        goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className='building-automation-info-bold'>Lighting Control:</span> Building automation can manage lighting systems, including dimming, scheduling,
                         and occupancy-based control. This not only improves energy efficiency but also enhances occupant 
                         comfort.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className='building-automation-info-bold'>Security and Access Control:</span> Building security is often integrated into the BMS. This includes 
                        access control systems, surveillance cameras, alarms, and automated responses to security breaches.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className='building-automation-info-bold'>Fire and Life Safety Systems:</span> These systems can be integrated with the BMS to monitor and 
                        respond to fire alarms, smoke detection, and emergency evacuation procedures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className='building-automation-info-bold'>Energy Management:</span> Building automation systems can track energy usage, optimize energy consumption,
                         and even generate reports for energy management and sustainability purposes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
