                <p>
                    Calibration is the process of adjusting or verifying the accuracy and precision of measurement instruments 
                    or equipment to ensure they provide reliable and consistent results. Calibration is essential in various 
                    fields where accurate measurements are critical, as it helps maintain the integrity of data and the quality 
                    of products or processes.

                <h2>Calibration Proccess</h2>
                <p>
                    The calibration process typically involves comparing the measurements of an instrument with a known standard or 
                    reference. If discrepancies are found, adjustments are made to the instrument to align it with the standard. The 
                    process may include the following steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Selecting a Standard: Choose a standard or reference instrument or artifact with a known, traceable measurement value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Comparison: Compare the measurements of the instrument being calibrated with the standard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adjustment: If discrepancies are identified, make necessary adjustments to the instrument to bring it within acceptable tolerances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Documentation: Maintain records of calibration procedures, results, and adjustments for compliance and traceability.
