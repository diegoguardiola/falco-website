                <p>
                    System Integration is the process of combining different computing systems and software applications to 
                    work together as a coordinated whole. It involves linking or interfacing various systems and subsystems, often 
                    from different vendors or sources, in order to act as a unified, cohesive system. The goal of system integration 
                    is to ensure that these disparate systems can operate together smoothly, share data and functions seamlessly, and 
                    function as a unified and efficient entity.

                    System integration can encompass a wide range of technologies and applications, and it is commonly used in 
                    various industries and fields, including information technology, manufacturing, telecommunications, healthcare, 
                    finance, and more. Here are some key aspects of system integration:
