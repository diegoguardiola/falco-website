                <h1>What Is Packaging Automation</h1>
                <p>
                    Packaging automation refers to the use of automated machinery and technology to streamline and optimize 
                    the packaging process in various industries. It involves the automation of tasks such as filling, sealing, 
                    labeling, sorting, and palletizing of products and materials into packages, containers, or boxes. Packaging 
                    automation offers several advantages, including increased efficiency, reduced labor costs, improved product 
                    consistency, and enhanced safety in the packaging process.
